# Monopoly-based Board game
## Disclaimer
This game was created to help me understand how react works, and how we can make things happen. The main goal of this project is to build a study case, so you will see bugs, mistakes, trial and error, terrible practices, and things we should not do in production. So, do not use it in production. i repeat: do *NOT* use it in production.

## How to run the project

- Clone the project
- Enter the directory
- Run ```npm install```
- Run ```Ç¹pm start```

## Problems to run the project

### Browser didn't open
If the browser does not open automatically, open http://localhost:3000/ manually

### I don't have NPM installed
You have to install NODEJS and NPM. You can find the programs here:
http://nodejs.org

Since every Operational System has a different method, you will have to check the instructions for you
